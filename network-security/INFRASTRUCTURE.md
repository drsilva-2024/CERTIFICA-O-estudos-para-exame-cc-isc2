## Concepts about Data Centers
| Data Centers | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) / Environmental | The HVAC system is responsible for maintaining the proper temperature, humidity, and air quality in a data center to ensure that servers and other equipment operate reliably. The environmental controls include monitoring and regulating temperature, humidity, and air quality to prevent damage to equipment. |
| Data Center/Closets | A data center is a centralized facility used to store, manage, and disseminate data and information. It typically contains redundant power supplies, backup generators, and backup systems to ensure data availability and continuity in the event of a power outage or other disruption. A data closet is a small room or enclosed space used to house networking and telecommunications equipment. |

# Cloud
- NIST resolution: A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (such as networks, servers, storage, applications, and services)â€¯that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. 

## Cloud service models

| Service Model | Definition | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SaaS (Software as a Service) | Software provided as a service over the internet. | Imagine you need to create a presentation for a client but you don't have the PowerPoint software installed on your computer. With SaaS, you can access the PowerPoint software over the internet, create your presentation, and save it to the cloud without installing the software locally on your computer. This is an example of SaaS. |
| PaaS (Platform as a Service) | Platform provided as a service over the internet. | Imagine you want to build a house but you don't want to worry about building the foundation and walls. With PaaS, you can use a construction platform that provides the basic infrastructure, such as the foundation, walls, and roof, and you can build the house on top of this platform, adding the finishes and customizations you want. This is an example of PaaS. |
| IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) | IT infrastructure provided as a service over the internet. | Imagine you want to create a garden in your backyard but you don't have the tools or materials you need, such as soil, plants, shovels, and watering cans. With IaaS, you can rent the necessary tools and materials to create the garden without having to buy or maintain them after the garden is finished. The service provider provides the basic infrastructure, such as gardening tools and soil, and you are responsible for taking care of the garden. This is an example of IaaS. |

## Deployment Models

| Model | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Private Cloud | Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization, managed by the organization or a third-party vendor, offers complete control over data and applications |  A private island that is owned by a single person or organization. The owner has complete control over who can access the island and what activities can be performed on it. |
| Public Cloud | Cloud infrastructure shared among multiple users over the internet, owned and managed by a third-party provider, offers cost-effective and scalable solution for businesses of all sizes | A public park that is open to anyone. People can come and go as they please, and use the park for a variety of activities such as picnics, sports, and events. |
| Community Cloud | Cloud infrastructure shared among several organizations with similar requirements, owned and managed by one of the participating organizations or a third-party provider, allows organizations to share resources and reduce costs while maintaining a higher level of control over their data and applications |  A co-op or community garden where several individuals or organizations share resources to grow and maintain a garden. The members work together to maintain the garden and share the benefits of the harvest. |
| Hybrid Cloud | Cloud infrastructure that combines two or more deployment models, such as private and public clouds, to meet specific business requirements, provides greater flexibility and scalability compared to a single deployment model | A house with both a private backyard and a public front yard. The owner has complete control over the private backyard, but can also use the public front yard for activities such as hosting a garage sale or having a BBQ with neighbors. |

## Some fundamental Terminologies

| Terminology | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Managed Service Provider (MSP) | A company that remotely manages a customer's IT infrastructure and end-user systems, providing services such as monitoring, patch management, and help desk support. MSPs operate under a subscription model and can help businesses reduce IT costs and improve system performance. |
| Service-Level Agreement (SLA) | A contract between a service provider and a customer that defines the level of service expected, including metrics such as uptime, response time, and resolution time. SLAs help establish accountability and ensure that service providers meet the customer's expectations. |
| Network Segmentation | The process of dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments, each with its own security controls and policies. Network segmentation helps reduce the attack surface and contain the impact of security incidents. |
| Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) | A network segment that sits between an internal network and an external network, typically the internet. The DMZ contains servers that provide services to external users, such as email, web, and FTP. The DMZ is heavily secured and is designed to prevent external threats from reaching the internal network. |
| Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) | A logical network segment that allows devices to communicate as if they were on the same physical network, even if they are located on different switches or subnets. VLANs help improve network performance, simplify network management, and enhance security by isolating traffic. |
| Virtual Private Network (VPN) | A secure and encrypted connection that allows remote users to access a private network over the internet. VPNs provide secure remote access to corporate resources and allow users to bypass geographic restrictions. |
| Defense in Depth | A security strategy that employs multiple layers of defense to protect against threats. Defense in depth includes a combination of technical and procedural controls, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, access controls, and employee training. |
| Network Access Control (NAC) | A security solution that controls access to a network based on user identity and device status. NAC solutions enforce policies that ensure only authorized users and devices can access the network, and that these devices meet certain security requirements. |
